# 📊 Probability and Statistics for Data Science

Welcome to the **Probability-and-Statistics-for-DS** repository!
This repo contains my **learning notebooks** and code exercises as I study key probability and statistics concepts essential for data science.

## 🧠 Why this repo?

While I had studied probability and statistics in school, I realized I never went beyond surface-level understanding — just enough to pass.
Later, trying to follow bootcamp code and machine learning tutorials, I constantly hit walls. It became clear: **I was missing the fundamentals.**

This repo represents my journey of going back to fill those gaps — **not just to code, but to truly understand.**

## 📚 Topics Covered

Each notebook contains annotated explanations, code examples, and practice using real or simulated data.

### 📦 Probability

* Random variables
* Discrete and continuous distributions
* Monte Carlo simulations
* Expected value and standard error
* Law of large numbers
* Bayes' Theorem

### 📏 Statistics

* Populations vs samples
* Measures of central tendency (mean, median)
* Variance and standard deviation
* Covariance and correlation
* Central Limit Theorem
* Sampling distributions

## 📓 Notebooks

The notebooks are organized for progressive learning. Each notebook typically contains:

* 📖 Conceptual notes
* 💻 Python code walkthroughs
* 📊 Visualizations using `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, or `ggplot2`
* 🧪 Practice problems and experiments

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

* Python (NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
* Jupyter Notebooks

---

## 🎓 Learning Sources

* **HarvardX – Data Science: Probability** *(Free via edX / Harvard’s site)*
* Supplementary readings and datasets from open-source resources
* This book helped me alot: `https://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu/dsbook/`

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This is an ongoing project. I’m actively refining and adding more notebooks as I learn deeper concepts and apply them in projects.
